We don't just grow plants here; **we help cool down the city**.

# Urban Greening

Merced gets hot. The garden plans serves as a testing ground for **heat-resilient street trees** and offers guidance to city planners and developers on reducing the urban heat island effect.

# Research & Conservation
A living laboratory for our local students. We plan to provide **research plots** for UC Merced ecology students, internship opportunities for Merced College agriculture students, and a hub for citizen science projects. Finally, we wanna demonstrate **cutting-edge irrigation tech**, greywater systems, and rain capture methods that local farmers and homeowners can adopt to save money and water.
