Hey! I'm looking for passionate co-founders to help me realize the dream of a botanical garden in Merced, or nearby. 

I live in Merced, and I work in Atwater. It sucks that if I wanted to see a botanical garden, I'd have to drive pretty far. I want to change this.

Anytime I'm traveling, I take time to visit the local botanical garden. Merced, which is growing quickly, is deserving of an equal attraction.
