## 2024-05-23 - Mobile Menu Keyboard Accessibility
**Learning:** When implementing keyboard accessibility for custom components like mobile menus, relying on existing state toggles (like `aria-expanded` attributes) is more robust than checking for CSS classes (like `.open`), as it aligns with semantic state and ensures consistency. Also, explicitly managing focus (returning focus to the trigger) is critical for a good keyboard experience.
**Action:** For interactive components, always include a specific `keydown` handler for the `Escape` key to close the component and return focus to the trigger element.
