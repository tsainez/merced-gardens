## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility Improvements
**Learning:** `target="blank"` is often used incorrectly instead of `target="_blank"`, and it's important to include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security and performance when opening links in new tabs. Also, ensuring `aria-current="page"` is present on active navigation links is a simple but high-impact accessibility win.
**Action:** Always check `target` attributes and active states in navigation menus during accessibility reviews.
