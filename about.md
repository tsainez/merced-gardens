# Objectives

This project seeks **passionate co-founders** who share the vision of bringing world-class botanical education and beauty to the heart of California. Together, we can create a garden that honors our agricultural heritage while cultivating the next generation of environmental stewards. 

Our **core objectives and goals** are to:

1. Create a **peaceful gathering space** for events, workshops, and cultural activities that strengthen community bonds while introducing residents to diverse plant life they may never have seen before.
2. Preserve and showcase **native Central Valley plant species** threatened by climate change, creating a living archive of our region's botanical heritage.
3. Celebrate the **Central Valley's farming heritage** through heritage crop displays, sustainable agriculture demonstrations, and active partnerships with local farmers.
4. Generate **tourism revenue**, create sustainable **jobs**, and enhance property values while positioning Merced as an attractive destination for new residents and businesses.

Merced is uniquely positioned for this vision. With a University of California campus bringing academic partnerships, a growing population, and our agricultural roots, we have the foundation to create something extraordinary. A botanical garden here would serve not just our city, but the entire Central Valley—connecting people to the plants that sustain our region and inspire our future.
