# Merced Botanical Gardens

Merced deserves a world-class botanical garden.

A space that celebrates the Central Valley's agricultural heritage while providing education, conservation, and community gathering opportunities.

## Roadmap & Needs

**What's done**

- Incorporated as a California nonprofit and filed for 501(c)(3) status.
- Completed early site fit analysis for several Merced locations.
- Built the founding board and hosted initial community listening sessions.

**What's in progress**

- Securing a land partner and defining a site access agreement.
- Developing a preliminary master plan with horticulture and design advisors.
- Building a grant pipeline and sponsorship deck for 2025 fundraising.
- Setting up a volunteer calendar for events, outreach, and habitat cleanups.

**What help is needed**

- Skills: nonprofit governance, fundraising/grant writing, marketing/outreach, legal/permits, and horticulture planning.
- Land leads: introductions to landowners, institutional campuses, or city/county parcels that fit a 10–20 acre garden footprint.
- Funding: seed donations, in-kind materials (irrigation, native plants), and sponsors for education and community programs.
- Volunteers: event staffing, communications support, and gardening/conservation advisors.
