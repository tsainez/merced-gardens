The first step in the life cycle of many plants is germination— and we've taken our first steps towards becoming a real thing. As of 30 December 2025, Merced Botanical Gardens is a Nonprofit Corporation recognized by California for Public Benefit under entity no. B20250431447.

**Mission Statement**

Merced Botanical Gardens exists to establish and maintain a botanical garden in Merced County for the public benefit. We are building a place for everybody— where people can encounter plants they might otherwise never see in their lifetime, and where living collections are cared for across generations.

Our goal is to bring native and climate-appropriate flora into a shared public space, creating a garden that grows older, richer, and more meaningful with time. We believe botanical gardens matter not only because they educate, but because they preserve living history—plants that outlast trends, institutions, and even their founders.

**Year One Focus**

In our first year, Merced Botanical Gardens will focus on:

* Establishing a small demonstration garden
* Beginning a curated plant collection, with an emphasis on native and regionally appropriate species
* Developing foundational horticultural practices that support long-term plant health and longevity
* Sharing knowledge informally through observation, documentation, and early community engagement

This initial phase is designed as a proof of concept: small, careful, and built to last.

**What Makes Us Distinct**

Merced Botanical Gardens prioritizes:

* Longevity over scale
* Living collections over short-term displays
* Public access over exclusivity
* Stewardship across generations rather than rapid expansion

We are intentionally building something meant to last longer than any one person, including those who start it.
