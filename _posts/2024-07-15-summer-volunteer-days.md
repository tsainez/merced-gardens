We are launching weekly Summer Volunteer Days with morning shifts to beat the heat and a cooling station stocked with water donated by a local grocer. Crews will help place decomposed granite along main walkways, weed invasive grasses, and refresh the temporary seating near the shade sails. As part of the same effort, a new hose bib and drinking fountain are being installed near the south entrance. Join us on Saturdays to meet neighbors, learn about plant care, and keep the gardens welcoming for visitors.
