We staked out the first set of native plant demonstration beds last week and began grading the pathways that will guide visitors through the new space. Volunteers logged more than 40 hours to move mulch, spread soil, and mark irrigation lines. Next up, we are scheduling utility locates and placing the initial order for drought-tolerant species so planting can begin in early July. Thank you to everyone who brought shovels, wheelbarrows, and encouragement to the site—your effort is making the gardens come alive.
