Our landscape designer led a field walk to map morning and afternoon shade so the pollinator corridor can host staggered blooms throughout the season. We are pairing early spring wildflowers with late-summer milkweed to keep bees and butterflies foraging without interruption. Local teachers also volunteered to help label each stop with student-friendly signage. If you have favorite pollinator plants that thrive in the Central Valley heat, we would love to hear your suggestions.
