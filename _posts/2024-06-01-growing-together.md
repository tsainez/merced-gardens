Merced Botanical Gardens is taking root thanks to the community members who have shown up for planning sessions, site cleanups, and early plantings. Your enthusiasm makes this project possible.

Over the next few months we will organize volunteer days, finalize our native plant palette, and begin designing signage for visitors. Follow the blog for updates and ways you can help shape the gardens.
